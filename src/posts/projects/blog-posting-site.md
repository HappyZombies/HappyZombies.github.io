summary: I'd like to talk about how I made this simple markdown blogging website.

I enjoy browsing Reddit and going to [r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/) to see what latest news fellow developers are talking about.

However something I noticed is that a lot of "articles" that are posted actually are simply a developers personal blog post.


```js
const a = 1;
console.log(a);
```

```csharp

using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
namespace DemoApplication
{
 class Program
 { 
  static void Main(string[] args) 
  {
   Int32 num=30;
   Console.Write(num);  
   
   Console.ReadKey();
  }
 }
}

```
