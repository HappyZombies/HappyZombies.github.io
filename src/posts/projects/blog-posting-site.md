Hey there, this blog post is not quite ready yet. However, the overall gist of what I want to talk about is how it took me over two years to finally publish/make this blogging post site. Every time I picked it up, the dependencies I installed were always out of date, and with it came breaking changes. I'll go into more detail about this later. Feel free to check out where this blogging site lives and use it for yourself if you wish. Happy coding!
